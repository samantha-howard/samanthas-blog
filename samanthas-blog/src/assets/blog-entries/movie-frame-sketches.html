  Sketches of Cool WomenðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¨

  After making the Jamie Lee Curtis painting, I figured it would be fun to paint some 
  <br />
  other iconic scenes from some of my favorite movies. So I painted a scene from the shining
  <br />
  and a scene of a Critter from Critters (my beloved) being a little nasty gremlin-guy.
  <br />
  This is a bit more of a detailed style that took longer to paint but still has a nice sketch-like appearance
  <br />
  I probably would paint in this style again but it does take quite a lot more work than some of the other styles.
