  Jamie Lee Curtis PaintingðŸŽ¨
</h1>
<p>
  Everything Everywhere All at Once is my favorite movie I think, and this scene with Jamie Lee Curtis just going wild while 
  <br/>
  flying down a flight of stairs to drop kick Michelle Yeoh in the face is such an iconic shot that it has
  <br/>
  lived in my mind rent-free forever. So I had to paint it.
