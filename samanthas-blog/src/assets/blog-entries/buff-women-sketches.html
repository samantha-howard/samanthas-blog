<h1>
  Sketches of Cool WomenðŸ’ªðŸŽ¨
</h1>
<div>
  The other week I had to take a few flights to travel back home and while I was on the plane
  <br />
  I was really bored and decided it would be a good time to draw some really cool women.
  <br />
  So I decided to use this pretty academic color scheme (analagous and complementary) and the end result is something I really liked.
  <br />
  It also has the added bonus of being something that I was able to complete on a few-hour-long plane ride.
