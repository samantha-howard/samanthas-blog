  Cauliflower Steak ğŸ¥¦ğŸ”ª
</h1>
<p>
  Turns out you can turn cauliflower into a pretty nice alternative to steaks. It is not a convincing meat replacement,
  <br/>
  but if you cook it the same way you would sautÃ© a normal steak it turns out really lovely.
  <br/>
  I made this by pan searing the cauliflower and then sautÃ©ed with herbs and other aromatics, basted with vegan butter
  <br/>
  and served it with caramalized onions and seared red peppers. It slapped, can't believe I didn't think of this sooner.
